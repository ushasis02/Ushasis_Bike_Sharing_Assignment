# Ushasis_Bike_Sharing_Assignment
Bike Sharing Linear Regression model
# Project Name
> This project tries to identify the demand of bikes based on a multiple linear regression model on a set of predictor variables


## Table of Contents
* Jupyter Notebook with the Python script for the model
* PDF document containing some answers to the questions on the model and subjective questions
* Python file of the model

## General Information
- First the varaibles that have correraltion with each other are removed. Dummy variables are created for the categorical variables.  Test and train set splits are created.
- What is the background of your project?
Based on the bike demand data obtained for 2 years as well as the values of several predictor variables, a model has been developed which can predict the demand of the bikes based on the values of certain predictor variable. Fetaure selection was done and then the right varaibles with coeffcients were identified.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Trying to predict the demand of bikes based on the values of some predictor variables.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
The data set is the demand of the bikes and the predictor variables that has been collected over a period of 2 years


## Conclusions
- 8 variables help to define the demand of the bike 
- The fit of the model is at an adjusted R -square of about 58.8%

## Technologies Used
- Python Libraries
